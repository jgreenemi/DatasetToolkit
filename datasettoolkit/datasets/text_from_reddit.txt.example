Many of us had been waiting for this moment for a long time. Dozens of /r/SpaceX fans descended on the city of Guadalajara in Mexico for a chance to watch the brightest and most inspiring hour of the year.
As fans, we were attending the same events as the heads of the industry; we had no claim to the best seats in the house or to any kind of VIP treatment. But multiple SpaceX employees took it on themselves to better our experience this week for no personal gain of their own. This kind of selflessness was pretty damn inspiring and we’d be amiss if we didn’t at least acknowledge their professionalism and generosity.
Many of us queued early enough to be confused with Kanye West fans buying the latest pair of Yeezy’s - 4AM wake ups with queues over 8 hours before the event, attempting to speak in barely comprehendable Spanish to ensure we could queue and sit where we wanted to. This paid off initially! We managed to secure the best seats in the entire theatre - quite literally front row seats for the upcoming talk.
The day began with a round-table talk on “How Space Agencies Will Contribute to the Implementation and Follow-up of the Paris Agreement during COP 21” including key figures from all of the large space agencies around the world. NASA, ESA, CSA, JAXA, Roscosmos, DLR, ISRO and, of course, the Mexican Space Agency.
Before the talk, we had the pleasure to meet the cordial and witty Jan Wörner, the Director General for ESA, who spoke amicably with all of us, telling us why he’d get us to Mars before SpaceX (with a quick stop on the Moon). He then took a moment out of his presentation to tell the entire IAC how pleased he was that so many young fans had camped overnight to view his speech on Climate Change. Great guy.
Of course, it can never be perfectly perfect :). We were informed that the rows we were sitting in were reserved for VIPs, you know… those pesky Heads Of State, moon-walkers, government officials, celebrities, and event organizers. We were meant to be seated about ten rows back in amongst the far larger general attendance, two to three times more distant from the stage.
Fear not, young fans! Emily Shanklin & Dex Torricke-Barton of SpaceX approached and spoke with us, were incredibly understanding of the dilemma (and sympathetic to the cause), and managed to negotiate with IAC officials exceptionally well placed seats, grouped in amongst the VIPs; in the first, second, third, and fourth rows. This is above and beyond anything we could ever have considered possible.
No one asked them to do this, there was no requirement for them to do so. But they did it anyway. Can you name one other large company that treats their fans in such a generous fashion?
We were allowed to queue in the VIP access line at the side of the venue, treated to free post-it notes to indicate our unique affiliation, and allowed to enter into the VIP section, in front of press and the rest of the attendees. We did our best keep our line tidy and organized. For comparison, here’s r/SpaceX queuing… and here’s the rest of the VIP officials.
The talk was great. We were in shock for sure. We sadly had no chance of asking questions - being seated in the VIP section meant we were roped off from the general crowd; and the microphones were positioned behind us at the front of the general attendees, which meant we had to get out of our seats and move back, not forwards. Out of the 3000 people in attendance, maybe 1000 tried to ask a question. TVD ran to the queue, but there was very little chance for him (however, he did meet some interesting people while queueing). There may be a reprieve coming soon though, which hopefully we can discuss at a future date.
There’s so many great people here. Of course we have to extend a big shoutout to Robert Clark (/u/ForTheMission ) who made subreddit lanyards to replace the stock Lockheed Martin (awkward!) ones we were given.
Here’s two messages from some of the attendees we’ve had the pleasure of hanging out with over the past few days:
In regards to the VIP seating they were able to negotiate for us, thank you for recognizing that we are more than a simple web community and that many of us are talented individuals with the skills to actively contribute. They really showed they value us today.
- Robert Clark (/u/ForTheMission )
Being able to attend Elon's talk at IAC 2016 in itself was an amazing experience. But the accommodation and enthusiasm that the SpaceX team showed the individuals from r/spacex who attended the talk went above and beyond. Emily, Dex,... cool bald Bodyguard guy, you all made the day one that we will never forget. It truly cements how amazing a team Elon has working at SpaceX, and I look forward to following your progress and promoting your goal for years to come.
- Ryan Scott (/u/101Airborne )
I’m a dancing machine … I really like Mariachi bands
- Elon Musk (/u/ElonMuskOfficial )
To finish up the day, we held the subreddit attendees meetup at 6PM at a nearby hotel restaurant; consisting of a mix of drinks, appetisers, mains, and desserts for the 30 people who attended. Great bunch of people. Thank you to the wider subreddit and other generous citizens who donated to the IAC crowdfunding campaign for us. It would not have been possible without you.
We’re still midway through the conference, so we haven’t had time to fully organize our photos and media just yet, but so far we’ve thoroughly enjoyed our time here and we’ll post more photos to come. On behalf of the subreddit, we’d like to say thank you to everyone involved.
TVD & echo (Declan & Luke).
Hi /r/spacex!
My name is Brian Bjelde. I trained as an aerospace engineer at the University of Southern California. After working briefly at NASA JPL, I joined SpaceX in 2003 as an avionics engineer on the Falcon 1 program and went on to become Senior Director of Product and Mission Management.
Verification photo
Since 2014 I’ve led the HR team at SpaceX, where we focus on how to hire and develop great talent, create more efficient and effective teams, and help develop SpaceX’s company culture. You can find all of our career opportunities at spacex.com/careers
I'll be here answering your questions from 10AM-11AM PDT!
EDIT: 11:30AM PT- Wow, I'm blown away by the number of questions this morning! I need to run, but will address a few more questions throughout the day. Thanks for all you do in supporting our mission! -BB
Here we are, r/SpaceX! It’s the launch we’ve all been waiting for - SpaceX has managed to build a rocket booster that can launch a 2nd stage+payload towards orbit. Then they have modified it so it can guide itself safely back to the surface. Then they successfully landed precisely on a moving platform in the Atlantic Ocean. Then they made it endure more static fires, analysis and refurbishment. And now here we are, waiting for it to fly again, less than 12 months after its maiden flight.
All aboard the HYPErloop!
Your host for this beautiful launch is u/TheVehicleDestroyer . Don't think about it too much.
Mission Status

Convert the launch time to your timezone here!
SpaceX is currently targeting a
  March 30, 2017 18:27 EDT / 22:27 UTC
evening liftoff from KSC, lofting SES-10 into GTO. This will be a 2.5 hour launch window, closing at 20:57 EDT / 00:57 UTC. If the launch is scrubbed, the backup launch window is at the same time on April 1st. The weather is currently 80% go for the primary window.
The Mission in Numbers

This is the 1st flight of a previously flown Falcon 9 booster stage!
The SES-10 satellite has a mass of 5281.7kg
The satellite will be placed in a 35410 km x 218 km x 26.2° geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).
The satellite will need to provide 1,803m/s of ΔV to reach geostationary orbit (GEO) after separation from the Falcon 9 2nd stage.
This is SpaceX’s 3rd launch out of Launch Complex 39A, and also SpaceX's 3rd launch for SES, following on from the successful launches of SES-8 and -9 in December ‘13 and March ‘16, respectively.
This is the 32nd Falcon 9 launch, flying on the B1021 core which was previously flown on the CRS-8 mission.
So most of us SpaceX fans have been through this: after showing SpaceX launch videos and explaining the whole amazing "SpaceX wants to settle Mars!" story to friends, and after convincing them that:
"No, SpaceX is not joking, neither am I!"
"No, they are not trying to swindle us out of our money either!"
"No, it's not some sort of cult either and I'm totally fine!"
... chances are high that the next question goes along the lines of:
"So why should we go to Mars, isn't Earth good enough?"
... at which point the standard NASA line of "It is true that Mars is a cold, barren rock with a poisonous atmosphere that barely exists to begin with and which is awash in hard radiation, yet on Mars humanity can explore whether microbial life ever existed there, and we can research the early evolution of the Solar System as well, for a super low price of just 100 billion dollars!" - or even the brilliant answer by Dr. Robert Zubrin ("Mars is where the science is, it's where the challenge is, it's where the future is"), or even the idea of creating a "backup" for humanity sounds a bit too altruistic, too unconvincing to the average person.
I think the better way to answer this question is to offer a few snapshots of how everyday future life on Mars could conceivably look like in a couple of decades, as experienced by an average adult from Earth, only using existing technologies and the vast resources of Mars:
Winged flight: On Mars you will be able to fly up 300 feet (100m) into the air, using your own muscle power only with carbon fiber wings, within large, self-pressurized domes that are trapping the heat of the Sun and are hosting jungles with trees that grow ~2 times higher than on Earth.
Extreme cliff diving: On Mars you will be able to do safe cliff diving jumps from 160 feet (50m) tall trees into crystal clear water. Mars has plenty of water: if all the surface water was molten then it would create a whole-planet ocean more than 300 feet (100m) deep. (!)
Waterfalls: And the Martian waterfalls! In low Martian gravity they are falling down in a gracious arc (almost) defying gravity. You can watch them all day and not get bored.
Running: On Mars you will be able to run at a speed of 30 mph (50 kmh), faster than Ushain Bolt, without breaking a sweat. (But stopping is not so easy, admittedly.)
Jumping: On Mars you will be able to do a standing jump to higher than 80" (200 cm) - higher than the current standing jump world record of 60" (150 cm).
Diving: On Mars you will be able to go scuba diving into (warm) water filled underground lava tubes and dive 330 feet (100m) deep with regular scuba equipment, without special deep diving equipment and without lengthy (and dangerous) decompression cycles.
Tropical Rain: In the Martian jungle you'll experience rain like you've never experienced it on Earth: round, thick raindrops falling down as if in slow motion. A mesmerizing sight - and very relaxing!
Sleeping: On Mars you will also have the sleep of your lifetime: in 37% gravity the lungs move easier and are less compressed, and your own weight restricts blood flow in limbs a lot less. Also, in the low Martian gravity snoring is no more!
Put differently: while zero gravity is annoying to us humans (things move too easily and don't stop moving, and there's also that confusing lack of direction!) plus zero gravity is super unhealthy to human bones and eyesight, in Mars gravity, which is about a third of Earth gravity, you'll not just be healthy but you'll also be a literal superhuman.
By all likelihood Mars will be a superior living experience to the average human.
But beyond the sheer experience level that Mars offers to the luxury cruise traveler, there are a couple of practical 'business' advantages as well to living on Mars, should you decide to live, work and do business on Mars:
Time: You probably know the common complaint that unfortunately there are only 24 hours in a day. As it happens on Mars there's an extra hour available every day! It can be used to catch up on sleep - or to do a bit more work.
Real estate: Real estate on the surface of Mars is still cheap (well, except real estate in or around Elon City), especially ever since the Martian government started not just giving away new land use licenses but started paying people to settle new land and make it habitable.
Exporting rare resources to Earth: Mars is very rich in mineral resources, for example if you find such huge gold meteorites nuggets lying on the surface of Mars like this iron meteorite then it's very likely profitable to bring the gold back to Earth: if a round-trip of a single person weighing ~100 kg costs only $500,000 then it sure makes sense to bring back 100 kg of gold from the surface of Mars, worth around $3,000,000 back on Earth. Rhodium and Platinum are similarly valuable as well. (Just make sure you don't ship back too much of it, to not collapse the terrestrial market price.)
New science: For space geeks Mars is where the science is not just in terms of researching the history of Mars or that of the early solar system or having an easy repository of on surface meteorites to look at, but it's also a natural 'clean skies' environment where you could probably be doing astronomy all day around with no light pollution and further away from the Sun. Probes sent to the outer planets or to the asteroid belt could have a much faster turnaround, lower launch costs and lower communication latencies than probes from the Earth. Not to mention exoplanet studies would probably be easier from the surface of Mars than from the surface of Earth.
Propellant production and shipping: With local manufacturing it would also be cheaper to launch mass into Low Earth Orbit from Mars than from Earth, so even sending plain bulk propellant to LEO could potentially be cheaper from Mars. (Until the Moon or near Earth asteroids are settled.) It's definitely cheaper to send propellant from Mars to High Earth Orbit than from the surface of Earth.
Advanced space robotics industry: Since for many years there is going to be a scarcity of human workers, Mars will be a natural industrial environment to utilize robots in. Because the atmosphere of Mars is very close to vacuum, Mars robots might be a natural fit for LEO and in general space construction jobs as well. It would also be cheaper to launch them even to LEO, and much cheaper to launch them to Luna or other high orbit targets.
Advanced spaceship manufacturing: Mars is also (when there are no dust storms) a natural 'clean room' environment, which could host a high value manufacturing base that could build things like spaceships: a very thin, cold, dry and non-oxidizing atmosphere is ideal to build sensitive machinery and to run sensitive industrial processes in.
Utilizing the main asteroid belt: It's much cheaper and much easier to settle the main asteroid belt from Mars than from Earth, so it might be the next natural step from there.
Sports rights: Live games of the MFL (the Martian Football League) are an unexpectedly huge ratings hit back on Earth (and nobody cares about the ~20 minutes delay), especially since they allowed the 'Salto Mortale' offensive formations last season. Even the best NFL players back on Earth look clumsy in comparison. The 85 yards field goal last week became the most popular sports clip of the year on YouTube! Likewise, Major League Baseball had a comeback with their Martian games and the NBA is in talks with SpaceX to extend the MCT with extra leg room to allow sending five teams to Mars to play the first interplanetary world tournament with the Red Devils and the Martian Musk-eteers.
The New Frontier: If none of this so far looks interesting to you, if a busy high-tech civilization is not something for you, then there's thousands of miles of largely unexplored planetary surface available for settling along the equator: plateaus, hills and caves never visited by humans before - waiting to carry your footprints, your habitat, your name.
TL;DR: I believe any of these areas could become the ultimate long term strength of the Martian colony, using only:
existing Martian natural resources,
the energy of incoming sunlight,
deep geothermal,
utilizing existing technology known to us.
It's not sci-fi, all it needs is for someone to start shipping stuff and people to Mars to create a critical mass of civilization.
Once that starts happening, Mars will be 'fun' for the average person pretty quickly, and IMHO in a few decades the bigger problem will likely be as how to limit immigration to Mars to safe levels, not to convince people to travel.
If you think any particular idea above is unrealistic or is outright not allowed by physics, please mention it in the comments below and I'll answer.
BFR and MCT are imaginary rockets that exist in the shadowy ground between rumor and reality.
Their abilities have grown like elementary school gossip that becomes concrete fact with slim resemblance to the original truth. Seeded by leaks from L2 and cryptic hyperbole from Elon Musk, MCT and BFR have taken on monstrous proportions.
If some people are to be believed, MCT and BFR will launch a nuclear reactor shaped like Bernie Sanders into geostationary orbit 420 times per day while being refuelled for free by methane-excreting GMO algae grown in Boca Chica.
However, speculation fever is entirely excusable. SpaceX has shown a consistent ability to change the launch industry, and then increase the rate of change*.
I imagine this is what spaceflight during Apollo program felt like, except different because of the emphasis on reusability and Mars. In my opinion it's cooler than Apollo because of the emphasis on reusability. Also, Apollo didn't have its own Apollo to compare to. It feels like reuse and Mars are one-upping the Saturn V and I love that. I’ve never been more excited for spaceflight.
On September 27, at the 2016 IAC in beautiful Guadalajara Mexico, Elon Musk will launch Falcon Heavy present “Colonizing Mars - A deep technical discussion on the space transport architecture needed to colonize Mars” and all the rumors will die like mold splashed by bleach. In the meantime, it's fair to speculate.
Here are my ideas. In order to come up with a plausible design, I examined /r/spacex discussions and developed a set of constraints. Then I applied the rocket equation to find RTLS requirements and payload to orbit. I'm really excited about these numbers. The math permits a 2 stage architecture that lofts 236,000 kg to orbit, as well as a special modified tanker stage that can transfer 233,000 kg of fuel to the MCT in orbit, resulting in only two tanker trips.
This is the link to a (very) short interview of Eutelsat CEO Michel de Rosen published by a serious french publication back in June. Translation of the last question & answer:
Q: Did you talk about Mars? A: We discussed a project. He asked me "Will this help me go to Mars?". He meant: "Will this generate enough money to finance the trip?". It's his objective. Gwynne Shotwell, the president, told me that they spent over half of board meetings time talking about Mars. I wouldn't bet against Musk on the success of this crazy project".
I wouldn't have thought that the board would spend more time on discussing MCT/BFR architecture or financing than talking about systems closely linked to their short-to-medium-term revenue streams (F9v1.2, FH, or Dragon v2).
I realize much of this conversation might be speculative, however, I was unable to find such speculation elsewhere. I am interested in the potential manufacturing process for the 12 meter composite cryotank. I have some high level background knowledge of carbon fiber layup, but am looking for some input from those with more experience.
From what I understand, it appears that each section of the tank likely consists of prepreg tape placed on the surface of a mold. These can then be cured using an autoclave or oven process. My questions are as follows.
What are the possible mold configurations?
Can one mold consist of an entire cylinder (ends open) which will create the walls of the vessel as one piece? If this method is used, could the mold be removed it were metallic, or does a metallic mold require two half circle cylinders which then need to be joined? If so, can a foam type mold be used to create this section in a single piece and drilled out - or is this an amateur technique only?
It appears that photos of the tank have fasteners running along the hoop direction on each side of the tank equator. If each hemisphere is created as one or multiple pieces, then joined to together, how is this joining typically completed? If with fasteners, how is this achieved/what additional parts are required to bring them together? Can they simply force each half together, then overwrap with additional tape longitudinally to join them (thereby avoiding fasteners)?
Any thoughts would be much appreciated.
Since I keep seeing this question asked in the "Ask Anything" thread, I figured it deserved a full post to allow unified discussion. So far I've seen 2 hypotheses, and I'm going to add my own as a third:
The FAA is requiring them, just like they do for planes. i.e. they are "aviation" strobes or position indicators.
Personally I don't think this makes much sense because the beacons were placed inside of the legs such that they couldn't be seen until the legs were opened. That only happens in the final few seconds of flight.
They are a sort of signalling shortcut for the SpaceX ground crew. i.e. they switch from blinking to solid to indicate some milestone in the safing of the landed stage.
In the case of a failed landing, SpaceX is required to remove any floating debris from the ocean surface (they'd want to anyways for any possible analysis). Based on their filing for Vandenberg RTLS, wherein they discuss contingency barge landings and the possibility of explosions on the ASDS, they expect something like 25 pieces of floating debris. These are mainly from the legs, the COPVs, and the LOX drain line. Finding any such floating debris at night would be much easier if it had a blinking light on it.
I'd certainly like to hear if anyone has any other ideas on why the lights were there and whether previous flights had them. I looked at the video of the landed stage from the Orbcomm RTLS landing and didn't see any evidence of them being there.
Hi guys! Your enthusiasm is wonderful - we've had a million people submitting the news that NASA is poised to announce the new contract to follow on from the original Commercial Resupply Services contract, so we've decided to make a sticky thread to stop the discussion fragmenting.
Background

Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) are contracts awarded by NASA for delivery of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station on commercially operated spacecraft. The initial round, known as CRS1, awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo runs using their Dragon capsule, and $1.9 billion to Orbital Sciences (now Orbital ATK) for 8 cargo runs using their Cygnus spacecraft. Now comes the second round (CRS2) to follow on from the hugely successful first round. Whoever wins the upcoming contract will resupply the ISS in the 2017-2024 time-frame.
Candidates

Five companies are known to have submitted proposals to NASA: SpaceX, Orbital ATK, Boeing, Sierra Nevada, and Lockheed Martin. The old giants Boeing and Lockheed are already known (but unconfirmed) to have been eliminated from the competition, leaving just:
SpaceX Dragon, which launches on the Falcon 9, can return cargo to earth, can carry unpressurized cargo in the trunk, and is likely to be the least expensive. Major downside: is quite volume limited.
Orbital Cygnus, which launches on an Atlas V/Antares, has very high pressurized volume (almost triple the internal volume of Dragon), burns up in the atmosphere on return (useful for getting rid of trash). Major downside: new version of the Antares rocket has not yet flown.
Sierra Nevada Dreamchaser, which launches on Atlas V, returns cargo, lands horizontally using wings (high crossrange, gentle landing environment). Major downside: still needs further development, and has not yet flown in space.
It is expected that NASA will chose two out of three of these competitors. Each competing vehicle has both upsides and downsides, and it will be up to NASA to weigh the attributes of each against each other, depending on what it decides will be most useful.
Monetary value

It is currently unknown what amount of money the winners will be awarded. Each competitor will have proposed a figure in their bid, and the relative sizes of these figures will undoubtedly play an important role in helping NASA make their decision.
Ha! Hopefully that title got your attention.
So... I was discussing the recent hypetweet of Chris B's with a friend. Don't remember it? Here you go:
Tease: It may take weeks, or even months, to be announced, but what I've just been shown is THE most exciting thing EVER. #SpaceX
I think everyone here reasonably expects this to be related to SpaceX's Mars plans, probably concerning BFR/MCT. Still, it's kind of vague, don't you think?
Bergin later commented that on a scale of 1-10 of hype, it was a "236". 236. Why 236? Why pick a seemingly random number? I realize some people like to joke and give oddly specific numbers when asked generic questions, but this doesn't seem like that.
I don't think that number is just a joke.
What performance indicators do we know could be in that numerical range? Thrust is definitely out, Isp is (hopefully) out.
Let's switch topics. What do we know about Falcon Heavy? Supposedly, with the recent F9v1.2 upgrades, it might be able to take 58-60t into LEO, in a totally expendable configuration with MagicCrossfeedTM. Seems kind of high, but apparently SpaceX can defy the rocket equation so who am I to argue.
Roll back a few hours today and we have this interesting quote from Gwynne Shotwell:
"Mars rocket will have three or four times more thrust than Falcon heavy."
Big deal, right? We already ruled out thrust. Say, for a second though, that thrust is roughly analogous to payload to orbit...
Goddamn it echo, drop the narrative and get to your point!
What if 236 instead represents the number of tonnes SpaceX's Mars rocket can take to LEO?
Don't believe me? Watch this Half Life 3-esque math:
236, payload to LEO of hypothetical Mars rocket / 4, Upper limit for scaling factor between thrusts of FH and Mars Rocket = 59, right in the center of FH's predicted payload to orbit.
Cool, huh? What are the chances of that being a coincidence?
What I don't know is whether that value would hypothetically be expendable or reusable. It seems like it needs to be the reusable value if we follow a SpaceX-preferred approach of a single launch to get all the equipment up and then another to refuel. It also fits right down the line of being able to land "100t of useful payload" on Mars.
Now, I totally agree that thrust does not scale linearly with payload. There's huge performance differences between both vehicles, namely due to their different use of propellants and their inherent efficiencies - so I could very well be wrong here...
..but something feels right about this. I'd love some feedback on your thoughts/how crazy you think I am. This rocket is going to be amazing.
SpaceX have announced they intend to launch their Mars Colonial Transporter in 2022, which has effectively fired the starter pistol for bids from all the states who wish to host the custom built MCT launch site. For SpaceX to meet this tight timeline to launch MCT they should be deep in the selection process for possible sites. Gaining the necessary construction and launch permits is an extended process which can’t commence until they decide on a suitable launch site
SpaceX are currently constructing a Falcon 9/Falcon Heavy launch site at Boca Chica Beach Texas which in theory could be extended for MCT use (given the required permits). However, it is not at all certain that this is their intent, there are many other states who would love to become the first step to Mars. Recently SpaceX’s Senior Council Schenewerk advised Texas legislators that NASA offer a $20m infrastructure grant, as an apparent prompt for the legislators to sharpen their pencils over Boca Chica.
“We appreciate Texas’ commitment to this industry and the recognition that it is a growing opportunity for this state. Jobs, high tech, manufacturing, STEM education – we bring it all and we are very excited to make that contribution,” Schenewerk said.
It could even be argued that SpaceX’s relatively slow pace of construction at BC (compared to Pad 39A work at the Cape – the HIF appeared like a mushroom overnight) could be aimed at procuring the best possible subsidies and tax breaks from the State and local authority for the follow on MCT work.
Cape Canaveral would love to host MCT launches and quite possibly Georgia and Puerto Rico too. Unfortunately more northerly states are probably out of the running because SpaceX would prefer to launch as close to the equator as possible, to maximise the payload they deliver to Low Earth Orbit (where they intend to refuel MCT). Puerto Rico is certainly the dark horse in this race, they are considerably closer to the equator (18 degrees latitude) and could provide an ideal location for both launches and landings (from the East and West) on the island of Vieques Naval Base. Georgia should also be highly motivated to receive this MCT work after they lost out to Texas in the competition to host SpaceX’s first private launch site. Boca Chica (26 degrees latitude) would appear the safe bet for mainland sites - if it wasn’t for their reticence in providing further financial support.
Recently we learned NASA and SpaceX have been in negotiations regarding Mars missions since 2014. NASA must be licking their lips at the prospect of MCT launches from the Cape (28.5 degrees latitude). Reportedly some people believe NASA was closed after they ceased launching Space Shuttle, so they would love to show the world they are back at the centre of space exploration. The question of where MCT should be launched presumably came up (either directly or indirectly) at these talks, with NASA no doubt offering their $20m infrastructure grant as a platform for further negotiation.
However, it’s quite possible the matter of who will host MCT has already been settled. Last week Elon Musk met with the Secretary of Defence Ash Carter during which the topic of MCT probably came up. An MCT launch failure could have the equivalent destructive force of a tactical nuke, hence this falls well within the Sec-Def’s purview. Elon was certainly pumped about MCT in his subsequent Washington Post interview:-
“This is going to be mind blowing,” he said. “Mind blowing. It’s [MCT] going to be really great. I’m so tempted to talk more about the details of it. But I have to restrain myself.”
so something appears to have been agreed, at least verbally. Thing to watch out for now are applications for EPA permits…

Hello awesome SpaceX Sub-Reddit!
I have some questions on the desires for the SpaceX Technical Webcast. On the first webcast we had shots of the rocket and countdown net only. But this means you never get any technical or status updates from John I.
On the last couple of attempts we have been playing John I's audio on the technical webcast, but that means that he may speak over countdown net.
Here are the options as I see them:
Do not bring up John I's audio and only have Countdown Net loops
Bring up John I's audio and Countdown Net loops. This means there may be times when both John I and the loops are speaking at the same time
Bring up John I's audio and while he is up, kill the Countdown Net loops. In this scenario you'll hear John I but if someone says something on Countdown Net you'll miss it completely on the webcast.
Here is a quick poll I created to help tally the results: http://www.strawpoll.me/6964455
I'm also open to other options. Keep in mind that this problem only happens when John I is speaking and does not apply to any other time. If John I is not speaking, you'll get Countdown Net (assuming they are saying anything on the nets).
[EDIT] -- Based on the data below and the Straw Poll, I will be eliminating John I from the technical webcast and he will be on hosted only.
EDIT: Decided to add some explanatory text for the thought process that went into the speculated numbers I give in this thread. It's at the bottom of the submission.


So, to re-iterate a little more about the projected capability for F9 FT.
A. F9 v1.1 has "demonstrated" an expendable capability of ~ 4,850kg to GTO-1800. Two sets of data compound to that assertion.
The biggest GTO payload was the 4,707kg TurkmenAlem52E. It was placed in a roughly GTO-1765 orbit (180x36600x25.5)
Thaicom 6 (a 3,016kg sat) got to a GTO-1500 equivalent orbit (295x90000x22.5). This stretched S2 fuel reserves to almost complete depletion (according to USAF, which evaluated this flight as part of the SpaceX EELV certification procedure).
B. F9 FT as a whole is reported to be around 30% more capable than F1 v1.1
C. DPL (barging) costs about 15% performance.

This means that F9 FT has a theoretical expendable capability of about 6,300kg to GTO-1800 DPL moves it to 5,355kg. SES9 is 5330 kg.
Its looking very close. Depending on whether the rocket goes to DPL or not, as well as what the end orbit is, we are going to get a lot of info about the current Falcon variant capabilities.

If this pans out, and RTLS removes another 15% of performance, F9 FT would be able to RTLS after sending a 4410kg payload to GTO-1800. This number is interesting for some of the following missions (not ordered according to schedule):
Hey all!
A lot of questions have been raised recently about how exactly SpaceX prices their products, the performance of Falcon 9 & Falcon Heavy, and how these prices relate to the real world contracts that have been signed by SpaceX with satellite companies and the government. There's quite a few community members here (I'm talking to all those who joined post-Musk-AMA) who may not realize some of the intricacies involved, and I think there's perhaps a few misconceptions to dispell overall. I've been a SpaceX fan for maybe 8 years now (watched F1F4 live!), but it's only been in the past 2-3 that I've had the maturity and knowledge to actually understand a bunch of accounting/physics/mathematics concepts to start performing a variety of analyses. Now, I don't claim to be an authoritative source here, and finance/business is not my area of expertise; I'm just offering my interpretation of their pricing, which I believe to be the "most correct" - backed up with evidence I have accumulated over the years. I hope you all find it agreeable, and I'm going to try and be as factual as possible.
To start, SpaceX's launch pricing & payload capacity claims that are available on their website are generally correct enough that you can perform crude back of the envelope calculations with reasonable "enthusiast-grade" accuracy. Listed in US dollars, these online prices refer to launches booked for a 2016 flight, so when SpaceX raises their prices, they're also attempting to factor in inflation into their future lineup.
Onto the real meat.
Falcon 9

Falcon 9 is currently advertised with a reusable payload capacity, but an expendable price of $61.2m. How do we know this? Payload:
Musk has stated that they reserve a significant percentage of their capacity for reusability.
Physical proof: SpaceX are also flying some large payloads that well exceed their stated capacity. AMOS-6 for example, scheduled for a 2016 F9 flight, is 5,500kg. Well exceeding SpaceX's claim of 4.85t to GTO. If 4.85t were the true maximum, this flight would be impossible.
For further evidence, we can corroborate against NASA's Launch Vehicle Performance Query Website. Enter in an inclination of 28.5 degrees with a 200km circular orbit (these are essentially the same baseline specifications SpaceX use to rate their vehicles) - Falcon 9 shows a performance of 16,625kg, while SpaceX claims 13,150kg. Additionally, if you enter an elliptical query with an apogee at GEO altitude, the response for Falcon 9 is 5,755kg - which fits nicely with AMOS-6's mass.
For the Falcon 9 pricing:
Commercial flights match SpaceX's quoted prices very closely, Eutelsat and ABS paid "approximately $30m each" for their dual flight last month. However, there is significant give: SES-8 paid "well under US$60 million" for their flight, which is only fair considering it was SpaceX's first GTO flight. Orbcomm paid $42.6 million for 2 flights!
Government-launched flights are more murky. SpaceX has stated an Air Force launch will cost approximately $90m. This matches well with TESS, which NASA is paying $87m to launch. The cost to launch DSCOVR is completely unclear.
Initial reusability pricing has already been decided upon. I'm not willing to share, but it's a significant drop, and it's also nowhere close to the BS $200k-$10m values that have been thrown around at times - if this surprises you, you need to do more reading on the complexities of rocketry.
Yes, there are various additional optional extras that SpaceX offer for payloads, examples of which are demonstrated in this comment. These can add/subtract from the real cost, probably by +-$10m, but $61.2m is a good ballpark figure for commercial flights.
However, the advertized performance of Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy will not change, despite the introduction of "F9v1.2". While there will be real performance gains that will be realized with 1.2, these values do not improve on paper. Why? The F9 baseline specification (and FH) that SpaceX shows on their website, shares with their customers, and provides to NASA, is not able to be met with F9v1.1 - it's underpowered. The numbers online are for a paper specification of Falcon that SpaceX created when it was developing F9 & FH. This has been demonstrated with all prior GTO missions to date - recovery has not been attempted. Musk stated the tank stretch and engine uprating would allow SpaceX to achieve reusability on even GTO flights, which seems to dovetail with the "4.85t to GTO" claim. Regardless, I would still expect flights that exceed this mass to be expended.
What was SpaceX's rationale in doing this? F9 was always their immediate launcher - they've always wanted reusability built in, so they just decided from the start that the numbers they'd show would be for reusability. But, because reusability wasn't instantly achievable, they had to offer the expendable pricing for F9 alongside it.
Falcon Heavy

This is the source of much controversy. But I'll do my best to explain what I see as the correct view. Falcon Heavy is currently advertised with an expendable payload capacity, but a fully reusable and (now hidden) partially reusable/expendable price. This is likely done to tout FH's monster lifting capability. Payload capacity explained:
In a fully expendable configuration, with crossfeed enabled, FH can deliver 53,000kg to a 200km 28.5deg inclined LEO. However, as we all know, crossfeed has been put in the "probably not going to happen" basket alongside second stage reusability. Thankfully, SpaceX state directly that the maximum payload to the same LEO without CF - 45,000kg. This is the correct capacity. However, sadly, these numbers aren't scaled across to the GTO and Martian capacities, which should be ~18,350kg (not 21,200kg) and ~11,400kg (not 13,200kg)
Furthermore, I imagine that there's some slight fudging done with these numbers, similar how the real world Tesla Model S range is always a smidgen less than stated, so be aware.
Reusability of the cores, especially the central core, drops the payload drastically. Musk has in the past stated all three boosters reused would equal about 7t of capacity. Keep this number in mind.
A lot of the questions I've seen is how can SpaceX offer 3x the number of cores for less than 50% additional cost. I'll try and explain that too. Pricing explained:
SpaceX used to publish 2 prices for FH. $85m for 6.4t to GTO, and $135m for what was essentially unlimited capacity. Today, the latter price has been hidden (but is crucially still in effect, and can be seen by using the Wayback machine) and the former is now $90m. No big deal, $5m isn't that much and $90m is bloody cheap for such a rocket anyway.
The "$90m for 6.4t" plan includes full reusability, it's totally cost ineffective for the cores to be expendable. More crucially, this number matches nearly perfectly for what Musk once stated: "three boosters reused = 7t". In this case, SpaceX have decided that 6.4t to GTO is the maximum that FH can take in a fully reusable mode. It also matches quite nicely with the initial reusability price offerings internally.
This gets bumped up to $150m (courtesy Gwynne Shotwell at the hearing) for the U.S. government. But then again, government is gunna' government - that isn't SpaceX's fault. Bear in mind - this is $150m for 6.4t to GTO capacity with full reusability, not $150m for an expendable rocket.
The wildcard is the now hidden $135m price that SpaceX marketed at one point for an "unlocked" Falcon Heavy. I can only assume it's probably more like $140m now (and probably $200m-250m for the government), but it likely either includes partial reusability of the boosters only or is a fully expendable value, and is the only price point where the full capacity of FH is unlocked.
What was SpaceX's rationale in doing this? Falcon Heavy was designed to be a heavy lifter. They wanted to emphasize that, so the published capacities are in an expendable configuration. But, FH simply wasn't going to be ready for a number of years, so they put a bet that by the time reusability is ready, FH would just be starting to fly - and it would fly with at least partial reusability from the start, so that's how they matched their pricing. That seems to be what is happening.
What is the immediate effect of this for us? Any calculated $/kg values for FH are completely false and don't make any sense.
The key thing to realize is that SpaceX's published payload capacities are paper specifications predicated off of a baseline - no single rocket matches it. F9v1.1 came close, but wasn't powerful enough. F9v1.2 is SpaceX's latest attempt to reconcile the different in actual rocket performance and the paper specification.
I hope you've enjoyed this post and that SpaceX's pricing and payloads are a bit clearer for a few people now. Let me know your thoughts, and whether you agree or disagree. I'm fairly sure this is the For what it's worth, you all should know that when you see any comment written by me that discusses pricing or payload capacity, this is essentially the set of rules from which I operate and make my assumptions. I'd be happy to respond to any suggestions or questions too. :)
So, in the midst of the party, I hope to not be the party pooper to ask the question nobody is asking: why should a BFR be built at all? If history teaches us anything, it is that past big projects that failed often brought down, or almost brought down, their parent companies. Can you imagine the consequences of a BFR failure? Its engineering and construction will likely run into the close billions at least, the consequences of its explosion will be critical to say the least - it is not a rocket that a company can just "build again", and I have my doubts that it will land successfully on the first try.
The reason I say this is because I do not understand what is wrong with using the by-then perfected Falcon 9 and Falcon 9 Heavy's reusability feature to perform 100+ flights to fully assemble a modular MCT in-orbit and then fly its passengers to it in batches of 5-10 people, the way it is done today for the ISS. The MCT could serve as a living area, operating exclusively in space, while the modified capsules in which the people will be sent to it can serve as Earth/Mars landers. Therefore an MCT architecture will comprise of a large structure, much bigger than the ISS, assembled in orbit over a multitude of flights, to which 10+ capsules will be attached in which passengers are delivered to and from it. These 10+ capsules will then perform Marsian landings and takeoffs as much as necessary to deliver both people and supplies.
It just seems to me that a 1 BFR, 1 MCT architecture is like putting all eggs into one basket, and it has to work from the very first try. Even if the first mission is autonomous (without passengers), it's failure could also mean the end of SpaceX's dreams of Marsian colonization as the financial consequence could be devastating. And if it's a failure with 100+ colonizers...
In conclusion, I feel at this point like the whole "giant rocket" idea seems more like a little boy's dream than a safe and fault tolerant scheme for us to colonize Mars. Your thoughts are welcome.
Post-discussion comments: thanks a lot to all of you for the great discussion! I certainly learned a lot about the architecture and its benefits over launching many smaller rockets. For massive colonization, I underestimated how much of a stress and risk launching thousands of rockets would pose in order to assemble in-orbit MCTs and to launch its crews.
The purpose of this post is to describe my interview experience with SpaceX and hopefully help out those either looking for employment at SpaceX or actively interviewing.
Educational Background: Graduated in 2013 from UC Irvine with a BS in Physics with a Minor in Biomedical Engineering. Cumulative GPA: 3.2, Major GPA: 2.9, Eng. GPA: 3.6. I never took any structures/materials classes and I will be entirely honest with you when I say I cannot answer any of these spaceX intern interview questions.
Professional Background I worked for a year and 3 months as an R&D/Manufacturing engineer catheter startup in the medical device industry (you wear many hats at a startup). After that, the job I just left was as a Process Engineer at a fairly large Medical Device company for the past year and a half. (As a side note, in the Medical Devince industry, nobody EVER uses knowledge from the college education. It is one of the few engineering fields where you can get a job WITHOUT an engineering degree. I know of engineers with art degrees, poli sci degrees, no degrees etc. The opposite is true in the Aerospace industry).
First Contact I got contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn. I was looking for a new job but I had not even considered the aerospace industry. The opportunity intrigued me and I decided to go forward. I told her upfront I have no Aerospace experience and was wondering why a company like spaceX which presumably has a hiring pool full of 4.0 MIT/Harvard Aerospace Engineers wants with little old me but she said she liked my professional background and they're looking to hire manufacturing engineers, which I did have 2 years of experience in. Also she said SpaceX hires for "raw engineering talent" which I don't believe in and actually interpret as a bit of a red flag. She asked to see my resume and if managers were interested, she would let me know. I sent her my resume. She asked me what I was looking for salary wise and I gave her a number. She was upfront about salary as well as saying they typically work 50-60 hour weeks and longer before launch deadlines.
Phone Interviews Recruiter said managers were very interested (I was surprirsed) and wanted to schedule a phone interview. I did two phone interviews which represented two different manufacturing groups: Propulsion Components and Structures. Propulsion interview went great. No theoretical questions, just typical interview questions about my work experience, projects that I worked on, problems that I encountered, what I wanted to do with my career, why spaceX, etc. Structures interview went OK but it was apparent it wasn't a good fit. I worked in high volume manufacturing where my projects were reducing scrap rate whereas they were building like 10 rocket bodies a year, no scrap rate. Both me and the interviewers agreed that that group isnt as good of a fit and the propulsion components group would be a better fit. The recruiter later told me that while they didnt feel it was a good fit, they still had positive things to say.
Onsite Interview A few days after the phone interviews, I got invited for the onsite interview. They scheduled it two weeks from the call. I have been to several interviews in my career but what was new was that I had to prepare a 10 minute presentation on a project that I worked on as well as an "executive summary" of my achievements (strange seeing as how my resume was essentially this, but OK). Interview day came around and I drove to Hawthorne (I live in nearby Orange County about an hour away).
Was able to find parking. I already had another job offer so I wasn't really nervous. From the outside rather unimpressive but lots of people going in and out. Once I got into the lobby, very futuristic and "modern" looking and could see into office space. I would describe it as what I would imagine google to be like. A nerd mecca for aerospace engineers (a good thing!). Once my recruiter met me we went on a brief 15 minute tour. The entire company is open cubicles with some people having standing desks (side note: I had never seen these before and they looked kind of creepy). Apparently only HR and Finance has true offices.
Took me by the cafeteria. Breakfast and Lunches are $5, Dinner $3, with a sandwich bar, smoothie bar, free coffee bar with baristas. That was very cool. A huge perk. The manufacturing floor was cool because I had never seen rocket assemblies and engines being built. This, as I expected, was a largely manual process (akin to building an engine yourself) and the production floor was rather messy compared to other manufacturing floors that I've worked. However, it didn't really bother me because I figured thats why they're hiring me. They had a cleanroom, which I had a lot of experience in from medical devices. From my experience I was able to point out some low hanging fruit that could improve their production floors.
After tour, I had my presentation up on their computer and waited for people to come in. About 10 people were there for my presentation. I presented on a project that I had initiated at my work to resolve a high scrap rate issues and the steps that I went through to figure out the root cause(s) and resolve it. No hardball questions mostly asked me to explain more about certain things. This is fairly easy to do on a project that you spend a few months on.
Afterwards they ushered me into a pretty small conference room where I sat and waited. The recruiter said they would deliberate whether or not they wanted to proceed with the interview. They chose to proceed and met with two of the interviewers I had phone interview with. We ended up continuing the interview over lunch (on the house, of course). The food was good but the portions were a little large.
The meat of the interviews After lunch is where I went through the meat of the interviews. I did about 4 separate 30-40 minute interviews with 1-2 people in each. Overall I would describe the interview difficulty as "medium". Nobody asked me any theoretical or textbook questions. Also, no philosophical questions about my thoughts on space or spaceflight. All questions were strictly business and directed towards work experience and projects. I think this is pretty easy when you spend 8 months working on a project alone you know all the ins and outs of it so there's not really anything anyone can drill you on. Overall interviews went great and gelled well with interviewers. They brought up numerous times the working hours and environment and asked if I was worried about it. I told them I worked at a startup before so I'm used to it and not scared of it. The only odd questions I got was one interviewer asked me: 1) how many launches spaceX had done 2) what was the name of the rockets 3) how many rockets there are in a falcon assembly. I didn't really know 1) and 2) but I did my best. He was an exception, not the rule.
Overall the interview went from 10:30AM-4:00PM. It went well. A week later the recruiter called and said that the interviewers said great things. The direct manager was unable to meet with me when I went in and he wanted to do a final phone interview just to get to know me before hiring me. At that point, I knew SpaceX was going to give an offer but decided for a variety of reasons that I'd rather take the other job offer I had on the table.
If anyone is interested I can discuss this more. Let me know if you have any questions about any other step in this process.
Now that SpaceX is gearing up for a busy 2017, I am curious to the subs’ thoughts on how SpaceX, their customers and the various regulatory agencies will view RUDs in the near-term and (mostly) long-term. New Space is very enthusiastic about increasing cadence significantly: SpaceX has their eyes on the LEO satellite network and massive colony fleets to Mars, not to mention their significant commercial backlog; Blue Origin plans to enable a massive orbital infrastructure and economy; even ULA is looking to join the fun as well with their proposed cis-lunar plans. Putting these plans into effect requires innovation, and innovation in rocketry usually means RUDs, like it or not. It may seem like SpaceX is prone to accidents, but in the scheme of things, its record is rather remarkable for a new rocket company.
With increased cadence comes increased odds of launch failures. 1:200 failure modes may not make an appearance in a rocket family that only gets ~100 launches before retiring (I always cringe when Tory Bruno tweets the number of successful ULA launches, stop tempting fate!). Supporting an orbital economy and Moon/Mars colonies will likely require many hundreds of launches per year in the future.
How will regulatory agencies and customers handle RUDs on reusable rockets? Will a F9 RUD on the 7th re-flight of a 1st stage ground all F9 for months, regardless of flight history? If an ITS launch fails at the beginning of a Mars transfer window, is that that, and the whole fleet is grounded for 6 months while the FAA reviews the anomaly?
Are we about to undergo a new “1950s” age of rocketry, where failure rates rise, but a significant amount of knowledge is gained? Can New Space weather this learning curve successfully while keeping customers happy? Are there lessons to be learned from the aviation industry?
These are the questions that always pop into my head when I read about future space plans. Customers want their payloads reliably delivered, regulatory agencies are slow and bureaucratic by nature and New Space needs significant innovation (and risk) to achieve their goals. Something has to change in this relationship for New Space to succeed in our lifetimes.
I’d love to hear the subs’ thoughts on these issues.
Falcon 9's automated launch aborts from recently remind us all that despite major progress, launching orbital rockets is still basically an all-or-nothing proposition - something that will continue to make it uniquely difficult even when (knock on wood) full and rapid reusability is achieved.
Certain steps help hedge a little bit on the zero-sum nature of launch - e.g., hold-downs after ignition, and engine-out survivability - but the process of launch after liftoff is still so "brittle" that the line between success and failure is excruciatingly narrow. Reusability will reduce the probability of failure, and the financial burden when it occurs, but will not make it any less total in the event of an in-flight RUD.
For SpaceX's long-term plans, this is something that must eventually be addressed, for both economic and safety reasons. An aircraft that experiences catastrophic technical failure on takeoff can turn around and land, and indeed that (fortunately) happens a lot more often than fatal crashes. But once liftoff occurs, an orbital rocket is committed: It must either find a way to limp to orbit despite whatever failures have occurred, or else sacrifice itself for the sake of ground safety (notwithstanding eventual LES for cargo and/or crew).
Given that F9 first stages can already handle hard landings ("hover-slams") with minimal fuel once the upper stage and payload are separated, this would seem like at least a rudimentary basis for beginning to think about recoverable FTS. Because, make no mistake, once in the cost domain of something like BFR/ITS that's intended to fly dozens or even hundreds of times, having totally unrecoverable domains of flight is probably not economically sustainable.
First, allow me to ask a naive question about an extreme case, since so much progress begins that way: What would it take to land the entire stack intact back at the pad after some brief period of flight?
Obviously the complete F9 stack is not designed to handle being landed, so quite a bit would need to change - it's very long and narrow, the interstage probably can't handle torques, the legs on the first stage aren't wide or strong enough, etc. etc. But the differences are not all negative: Only minimal thermal protection would be needed after a brief period in flight, and you have all the fuel you could need while having the option of dumping any that's not worth carrying.
It's not actually a crazy idea compared to the changes SpaceX has already made to the status quo of the launch industry, is it? At least for future reference, in terms of how vehicles can evolve. But having gone to the extreme, let's examine the more cautious question of stage-separate recoverable FTS. That would have some predictable events involved:
Emergency MECO.
Suppose failures occur that guarantee the stack cannot make it to orbit, but it retains enough function that the first stage could RTLS or hop to the drone ship. Given that the recoverable stages land with just 1 or 3 engines, while orbital capability only survives with at least 8 engines, this does not seem far-fetched.
The orbit-canceling failure having been detected, the rocket automatically shuts off, exactly as it would if still in hold-down mode after ignition.
Dump the 2nd stage propellants, and whatever amount of booster propellant might be a problem given the nature of the failure.
Bleeds off momentum, increases the safety of the stack, and allows drag to slow it down more quickly.
If the speed is already low enough, at this point you could have emergency stage separation; if the speed has gotten too high to safely separate while still in atmosphere, perhaps after venting the 2nd stage the stack is tilted just a little bit relative to velocity to increase drag manageably and reduce speed to where separation can occur.
Stage separation & payload escape.
The two stages separate at some angle that takes them away from each other while protecting their integrity, then whatever LES protects the payload or crew spacecraft activates. The second stage is still sacrificed since we're looking at this through the lens of the current architecture, but hypothetically future recovery systems could be incorporated there too. Maybe payload fairings could themselves be a part of an emergency cargo recovery system.
Booster relights and flies back, experiencing far less extreme temperatures and stresses than it would have anyway.
So we can see there's a spectrum of hypothetical possibilities for recoverable flight-termination. From the "crazy" notion of full-stack recovery from in-flight abort, down to "mere" payload and booster recovery.
I make no claims about the feasibility of any specific part of this analysis, but something along this spectrum will be necessary for an economical, sustainable Mars flight architecture, and certainly wouldn't hurt along intermediate steps.
Transportation is simply incompatible with zero-sum outcomes. The pursuit of reusability is just the most immediate acknowledgment of that fact.
With the re-flight of the New Shepard spacecraft, this seems like an appropriate moment to discuss what the future may hold for both companies with regards to the cost of launches, both for Falcon 9 and for the future Blue Origin single engined "Very Big Brother" (VBB). Remember the usual caveats with Blue Origin apply here - we know very little about their plans!
On the face of the issue, both companies appear to be following a very similar re-use strategy:
First stage is re-used, using a vertical landing.
Second stage is expendable - Neither SpaceX or Blue are currently considering second stage re-use (sad face).
However, there appear to be some minor differences:
SpaceX uses 9 first stage engines, making the job of landing easier.
Blue Origin wants to only use a single first stage engine - implying not only very deep throttling, but perhaps settling on a lower TWR first stage than ideal, and possibly general performance. [citation needed]
Blue Origin is initially going to build a much smaller rocket in the ~2017-2019 timeframe, which would only be able to compete with SpaceX for smaller launches.
Blue Origin probably isn't considering an ASDS-style landing, although they did attempt to file a patent for it, with the performance hit that RTLS will bring. So far we have heard of no further developments - but why would we?
And some pretty major ones:
Blue Origin is focusing solely on a methalox first stage for their orbital vehicles, with all the advantages that brings.
Blue Origin is planning on using a hydrolox second stage, with all the advantages and disadvantages that brings.
SpaceX wants to use a single fuel for the entire rocket, with all the advantages and disadvantages that brings.
SpaceX currently (and apparently intends to continue) manufacturing Falcon stages off-site and then trucking them across the USA to the launch site. Blue Origin plans to manufacture them at the Cape. This means they are not diameter-restricted as SpaceX are, but they then cannot have the diversity of launch sites SpaceX has.
The Blue Origin rocket appears to be two diameters, although where the interstage, second stage and payload fairing all start and stop is unclear.
Which leaves the question of who's will be the cheapest launcher. For the purposes of this we shall assume pretty similar reliabilities, as we currently have no reason to believe otherwise!
In my mind the overriding factor is the second stage, as it is expendable in both designs, and the obvious place to offload the now-in-excess first stage production capability.
A SpaceX upper stage uses very similar tooling to the first stage, so when first stage production winds down, the cost per unit will stay very similar. However, this means a less efficient rocket, although what effect this has on cost is unclear.
A Blue Origin upper stage is apparently going to be based on the New Shepard Spacecraft. Ignoring (wisely??) the development costs, this will mean a more expensive cost per unit, as hydrolox engines tend to be much more expensive than keralox or [citation needed] methalox upper stages.
Because there can be very little common tooling between New Shepard, VBB first stage and VBB second stage, as the diameters and materials will probably be different (although the second stage and New Shepard will share engines), how much more expensive might they be? Or might they have a method for bringing down the costs to below SpaceX's? If so, what might it be?
Many thanks for your thoughts!
